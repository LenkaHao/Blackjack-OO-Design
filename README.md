**How to start**

Run GameLauncher, which will instantiate and start a Blackjack game. It can start another card game when the game class is given.



**How to play and what to expect**

Step 1:
You can change two default configurations of the game.

Dealer's stopping value. Default is 17.
Balance for each player.  Default is 100 per player.

Step 2:
For each player, enter a bet.

Step 3:
For each player, go through their hands and ask for actions.

Step 4:
After all players finish, display results of the current round.
Each player with positive balance will be asked if they would like to cash out or continue.
If there are still players playing, return to step 2 and play next round.
Else, exit the game.
